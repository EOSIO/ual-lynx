# About EOSIO Labs

EOSIO Labs repositories are experimental.  Developers in the community are encouraged to use EOSIO Labs repositories as the basis for code and concepts to incorporate into their applications. Community members are also welcome to contribute and further develop these repositories. Since these repositories are not supported by Block.one, we may not provide responses to issue reports, pull requests, updates to functionality, or other requests from the community, and we encourage the community to take responsibility for these.

## Supported Environments
- The Lynx Authenticator is supported on Lynx Android and Lynx Desktop 2.0+

## Getting started

**Note:** be sure to read the [Warning and Limitations](#warning-and-limitations) section below.

`yarn add ual-lynx`

#### Dependencies

You must use one of the UAL renderers below.

React - `ual-reactjs-renderer`


PlainJS - `ual-plainjs-renderer`


#### Basic Usage with React

```javascript
import { Lynx } from 'ual-lynx'
import { UALProvider, withUAL } from 'ual-reactjs-renderer'

const exampleNet = {
  chainId: '',
  rpcEndpoints: [{
    protocol: '',
    host: '',
    port: '',
  }]
}

const App = (props) => <div>{JSON.stringify(props.ual)}</div>
const AppWithUAL = withUAL(App)

const lynx = new Lynx([exampleNet])

<UALProvider chains={[exampleNet]} authenticators={[lynx]}>
  <AppWithUAL />
</UALProvider>
```

### Warnings and Limitations
Using Lynx within your app is no different than using other authenticator plugins. However, if your application is being used from within the Lynx mobile app it is using an embedded browser to view the application. The main restriction is that the Lynx mobile app (and consequently the authenticator) can **ONLY** communicate with EOS Mainnet. So when setting up UAL, if you specify other chains it will not work. This is also true if you specify additional chains along with Mainnet. This can make testing difficult if your application is using contracts that are not yet deployed to Mainnet.

### Testing on Mainnet
For a simple test to verify that authentication is working, you can stick with system contracts that are already present on Mainnet (e.g. transfer). In this case you can run a simple app locally fronted by [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). Lynx DOES have the ability to point to an app for testing wherever it is being hosted (i.e. the ngrok url), but the app must only use Mainnet. Below is a brief outline of how to test Lynx with a local instance of your app:

* Start up your test application
* If running locally, front it with ngrok
* In your Lynx mobile app
  - Login as usual
  - Navigate to the "Explore" tab
  - Open the test URL
    * On Android, click the menu dropdown in the upper-right corner and select "Test URL"
    * On iOS, tap on the top navigation bar 10 times and you'll be provided an input to put in a testing url

From this point on, the app should behave as expected.
